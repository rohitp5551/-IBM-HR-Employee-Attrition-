# -IBM-HR-Employee-Attrition-
#Summary The goal of this project is to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. The rate of attrition or the inverse retention rate is the most commonly used metric while trying to analyze attrition. The attrition rate is typically calculated as the number of employees lost every year over the employee base. HR analytics is an up and coming area that can make HR departments in companies highly data-driven and improve their efficiency manifold. We used Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn packages to generate visualizations and sklearn package to gain insights into factors and trend lead to employee attrition.
